7 Mile Hole takes you right into the canyon and up to the river and it was one of the most beautiful hikes I've ever done. Hell of an incline going back up though.
------------------------------------------------
The fairy falls area in the southwest is very cool - lots of geysers and thermal crust/activity.  

Hikes that give you a view of Yellowstone Lake are a bonus - the scale of it is beautiful.

For true alpine time, head south to the lesser visited but truly stellar Tetons.  GTNP is a gem and a day hike up one of the large canyons should not be missed.

Source: lived and hiked there for three summers
------------------------------------------------
Fairy Falls, Lewis Clark Dogshed, Elephant Back, Lonestar (the real trail not the bike path), Mallard Lake (trailhead is behind employee housing but also next to Old Faithful Lodge), Bunsen Peak, Slough Creek.
------------------------------------------------
What's a "day hike" to you? As I would not label Uncle Tom as a day hike.  In my mind, a "day hike" is that - out and back in a day. 10-20 miles


Some of my favorites (4 - 12ish miles) Osprey Falls and Specimen Ridge. For a griz, check out hikes on Blacktail Deer Plateau.
------------------------------------------------
Your Teton itinerary looks pretty good. Although I'd highly recommend camping on top of Shadow Mountain. It's free, it's isolated, and the view when the sun sets behind the Teton Range and their shadows are cast aross all of Jackson Hole Valley.. well.. it's.. something truly special.  Not to mention you're close enough to all the major sights and trailheads in Grand Teton National Park. 

I'd recommend doing a portion of the Lupine Meadows trail (which will take you all the way to the summit of Middle Teton, should you feel so compelled) and maybe split off and check out Ampitheater Lake as well. 

As for Yellowstone... where to begin?  I'll just tell you some of my favorite hikes/sights at the locations you listed.   I wouldn't recommend staying at Grant Village -- it's okay, but it's kind of far from all the other good stuff.  Stop there, check out the West Thumb Geyser Basin, then head on up to Lake/Fishing Bridge and try to camp at Fishing Bridge or Bridge Bay your first night. 

Two of my favorite hikes in that area are "Storm Point" which is just a few miles east of Fishing Bridge, and "Elephant Back" -- both of which offer absolutely spectacular views of the Lake and surrounding areas.  While you're down in that area, I'd also recommend taking a drive down the East Entrance road, checking out some more of the lake views (you won't be able to get enough!) and maybe having lunch at Steamboat Point. Don't forge to check out Lake Hotel!

Lake to Canyon

Next up is Canyon Village, but on your way there from Lake, take a quick stop at the Mud Volcano area and LeHardy rapids.  After that you'll drive through Hayden Valley, one of the best spots in the park to check out wildlife, so you'll catch a bunch of bison (hopefully not in the road!), elk, pronghorn, and maybe even some wolves if you're really lucky. Spend as much time as you feel like you need to there then keep going up the road toward Canyon. 

Canyon, Canyon, Canyon, you magnificent spectacle you. I lived here for months and still never got enough of it, so having only one day to explore it is tough. But, pressed on time, make sure you head to Uncle Tom's Trail and Artist Point on South Rim Drive, and then hit the brink of the Lower Falls and then go to the other side and walk down the Red Rocks Trail.  Just ask anyone who works in the park how to get to any of these places and they'll point you in the right direction. If you're staying at Canyon, ask for Julie the front desk manager-- she's amazing. The campground at Canyon is pretty decent too. 

Canyon to Roosevelt

You'll drive over Dunraven Pass (hopefully it's open when you're there). At the top is Mount Washburn which is THE BEST hike to take if you're in Yellowstone and pressed on time. It's an easy 2 mile or so hike to the top and you can see EVERYTHING from the top. Seriously. Just do it. Mount Washburn. There's an old fire watchtower on the top that you can stop and check out too. It's awesome. Do it. 

Once you've conquered Mt. Washburn, head down towards Roosevelt. There's a campground at Tower which is where you'll stay if you're camping but I highly recommend driving a few more minutes down the road and staying in one of the rustic cabins at Roosevelt (if they have any vacancies, which they probably won't, but it's worth a shot). Tower Fall is pretty cool, I guess, but it's always super super busy with tourists getting ice cream at the general store there, and since you're pressed on time.. skip it.  Go to Lamar Valley instead. 

Lamar Valley. Wow. Hands down, my favorite place in all of Yellowstone. Wolves and bison and bears and elk and pronghorn and hawks and well the valley itself. It's amazing. Get up early and go there and hang out with the wolf watchers. They'll let you use their scopes. If you go to Yellowstone and don't go to Lamar Valley, you did it wrong. Drive all the way through it and do a quick hike at Trout Lake. Good, good stuff. 

Mammoth

I don't know, it's just me, in my humblest of opinions, but if you're short on time, Mammoth would be the location to skip.  Sure, Mammoth Hot Springs are pretty wild things to behold. But most of it is dormant, it's super crowded being as that it's park headquarters and the entrance for most tourists, and well, I don't know. I just didn't enjoy it as much as other areas of the park. Well, except for the Boiling River.  Which is awesome. It's on the road towards Gardiner, and it's a natural hot spring fed part of the river that you can swim in. So if you feel like taking a dip in one of the park's few spots where you can (legally) swim in the thermal features, hit up The Boiling River. Also, the Lava Creek Trail is one of my favorites. 

Next up is Norris Geyser Basin, which you should most definitely make a stop at.  It's a nice little boardwalk hike around the geyser basin and is the closest thing to standing on an alien planet that this country has to offer.  It's crazy. Maybe if you're lucky Steamboat Geyser will go off when you're there. 

Then shoot all the way down to Old Faithful (Old Filthy, as we savages like to call it) Make sure you stop along the way at the Fountain Paint Pots and Midway Geyser Basin (Grand Prismatic!!!)  Then keep going. If you feel like taking a swim, take the Firehole Canyon drive and swim in the Firehole River at one of my favorite swimming holes in the park (besides the secret ones, which I won't tell you about!) 

Old Faithful is like Grand Central Station of Yellowstone. There's an actual overpass on the road down there, which blew my mind the first time seeing it. Anyways, go there, watch Old Faithful erupt, walk around the rest of the geyser basin, eat some ice cream. La la la. 

That'll put you close to the West Entrance and on your way back to SLC


I hope that helps! I've just so happened to be thinking a lot about the park today and will probably go back and work there again at some point this summer. Enjoy your trip! And if you have any further questions, just ask. I'm a wealth of information about the park and only skimmed the surface of things to do with this post.
------------------------------------------------
Blacktail Plateau is about 7.5 miles and Osprey falls is about 8 round-trip. Both are absolutely gorgeous! They're also both in the northern part of the park near Mammoth /Lamar Valley.

Most hotels oversell because they count on a 10% cancellation rate. It happens, and it's likely to happen to quite a few people during the eclipse. If you show up and your reservation was cancelled by the hotel, they ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING YOU ANOTHER ROOM. If a hotel is oversold, and they "walk" you to another hotel, they should be paying for your travel costs to the other hotel, as well as your room and tax at the other hotel. You will also usually get a voucher for a free night or points for their loyalty program.
------------------------------------------------
Remember to file a complaint with the state attorney general if you had a reservation get canceled, and leave a TripAdvisor review so others are aware of the shenanigans. It's their right to charge those high rates, but not when you both agreed to the earlier price months ago and they booked you in.

Also if a cancellation ends up costing you additional money out of pocket, it's your right to sue in small claims court in their county, at least just for the principle of the matter.  Judges are people, too, and there's a chance they will be disgusted at these cash grabs and throw an additional award on top of your claim.  Document, document, document.

Finally, if a hotel honors the low price you booked, leave a positive review afterward on TripAdvisor, Google Reviews, etc... this is a place that opted to do right by their guests and not do the cash grab.
------------------------------------------------
Abyss Pool - it had been greenish/black the last few years but has heated up this summer. So great to be able to actually see its depth again!
------------------------------------------------
Message me. I still have cardboard/paper cardstock ones. They aren't plastic but if your lowes and 7 eleven and library have run out? They're American Paper Optics and I ordered directly from the manufacturer a couple months ago.
It seems like yours might be okay if you can only see the sun though...
------------------------------------------------
Just got back from family trip to Yellowstone.  I would highly recommend this book -http://a.co/gVRK9vc  Great variety of hikes with very specific directions and accurate difficulty assessments.  Check out Fairy Falls and Mt Washburn.  Do Washburn a little later in your stay if you are a coastal dweller like us and need a little altitude adjustment.

Most of the Grand Canyon north and south rim trails are closed (incl Uncle Tom's), but you can take the trailhead at Artist Point then back around Clear Lake and Hidden Lake trails for a diverse AM hike.  Get there early for that one though.

There's a momma black bear and her cub hanging out between Dunraven and Tower Falls - should be able to spot her from one of the trails around there.

If you are able to swing down to Grand Teton, the Phelps Lake trail is terrific.  Much different flora than Yellowstone.  The dirt road to the parking lot is rough, just keep going.
------------------------------------------------
Mystic Falls.  Two-mile hike to the falls, with an optional loop that climbs up to an overlook with a view up the full length of the Upper Geyser Basin to Old Faithful, nearly three miles away, before descending back to the trailhead.

Lone Star Geyser.  2.5 miles each way through old-growth forest along the upper Firehole River, ending at a solitary, isolated geyser that erupts every 3 hours.

Fairy Falls.  3 miles each way.  Just beyond the trailhead, there's an optional spur to an overlook of Grand Prismatic Spring, which just opened a few weeks ago.  The entire area was badly burned in 1988, so most of the way the trail winds through dense, young forest.  The fall itself is a single plunge of nearly 200 feet.  Optionally continue another mile to Imperial Geyser.  While Imperial itself is long dormant, a geyser on the edge of Imperial's crater is in near-continuous eruption to 40-70 feet.
------------------------------------------------
Lone star is great. Thats where i proposed to my girl
------------------------------------------------
There are tons of random pull offs. If it looks interesting just stop, if you miss it, there is likely one right down the road. My wife and I enjoyed these as much as the famous stuff. 

The side roads are also really cool. Firehole canyon drive was probably my favorite.
------------------------------------------------
It's the ridge of the valley, it's actually where you end up driving just north of Soda Butte.  On any given evening you'll see 10-20 people sitting there watching animals.
------------------------------------------------
Man, there are some really grumpy cowboys in here. I'll just say sorry for the not so warm welcome on behalf of the other Wyoming natives....

To answer your question, things (Yellowstone, for example) really start to shut down in mid to late October because of snow closing the roads. You should be totally fine in September.

Given your starting and ending points, here's what I'd do to maximize the "pretty driving" tour in a reasonable amount of time.

I'd hit Devil's Tower in the morning from Spearfish and then continue on and stay the night in Sheridan or Buffalo (Sheridan is a really, really nice town). Next day follow r/WyoPeeps good advice and drive through Ten Sleep Canyon on your way to the hot springs in Thermopolis. Have a soak. You could stay the night there or carry on to Lander via Wind River Canyon. Lander is also a very nice town with some [great local restaurant](http://www.landerbar.com/gannett-grill.html)s. From Lander you should spend a morning/day visiting Sink's Canyon before taking 287 up to 26 towards Dubois, over Togwotee Pass, and into Jackson and the Tetons.

From there you want to spend at least a couple of days exploring Jackson and Grand Teton National Park. I would then visit Yellowstone Park, exiting via the East Entrance so that you can hit Cody for a visit to the Buffalo Bill Center. The big thing to see in Yellowstone is Old Faithful and the surrounding Upper and Lower Geyser Basins.

From Cody you are set up for an Exit north into Montana and up to GNP. You can take the main roads or the scenic routes north from Cody.

Ignoring the numerous hidden gems (the Snowy Range!), the southern an eastern areas of Wyoming are by and large much less interesting to drive through. 

Hope that helps, feel free to inquire further is you want.

*EDIT: GOD DAMN, I forgot to mention where to get the best fucking steaks in Wyoming. There is a little town called Hudson between Riverton and Lander, and in that little town is a bar/steak house/dive called Svilar's. It is a Wyoming institution. Go there and eat red meat. Fear not the look of the town or the place, outside or inside.
------------------------------------------------
Awesome, have a great time. 

One bit of advice (that I've only read) is that you get a more visually striking view near the edge instead of the center, though the center gives you a little bit more time.
------------------------------------------------
If  you want to come as far west as Jackson,  there is tons of free public land. Curtis canyon  road, or Granite Hot Springs would be my first choice. Each has over 100 campsites that are free and first come first serve. You can camp in any national forest for free.
------------------------------------------------
Hwy 130 between Laramie and Saratoga. Short, but gorgeous
------------------------------------------------
Highway 14/16 between Cody and Yellowstone. Stunning.
------------------------------------------------
135 between Sweetwater Station and Riverton has a little stretch at Sand Draw that is simply amazing when you go over it close to sunset.
------------------------------------------------
My Favorite is HWY 20 between Shoshoni and Thermopolis.  Crazy drive through a river canyon complete with tunnels.

Close runner up would be HWY 16 between Ten Sleep and Buffalo

Both of these are great drives.
------------------------------------------------
How long do you have in Yellowstone, assuming you spend at least a day or two outside the park for whitewater rafting and ziplining?

Do you want to see other major frontcountry attractions besides thermal features and wildlife (the canyon, waterfalls, and Yellowstone Lake)?

Conventional wisdom says you can get a quick look at all of the big roadside stops in two or three days:

* One day for the upper loop (Mount Washburn, Tower Falls, the Lamar Valley, and Mammoth Hot Springs) 

* One day for the lower loop (Hayden Valley, the main thermal basins, a few minor thermal basins, and Yellowstone Lake).

* The canyon and Norris Geyser Basin on either day since they're on both loops.

* An optional third day to go to stops you didn't have time for, to spend more time in an area that caught your interest the first time around, or to go for a hike or three.

That's a rushed schedule that lets you see at least all the major roadside stops.  More days let you take a more leisurely pace, visit less-known attractions away from the roads, take a trail ride, rent a canoe on the lake, spend more time looking for wolves and bears, or whatever.
