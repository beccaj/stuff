While creating my list of the Top 10 Hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park, I realized that many of the trails that made the list were fairly long day hikes, which obviously won't appeal to everyone. So I decided to start from scratch and build a new list, based on the best of the easier hikes in Rocky Mountain. Hopefully you'll find this helpful as a starting pointin trying to decide where to hike during your visit.
