While creating my list of the Top 10 Hikes in Grand Teton National Park I realized that many of the trails that made the list were fairly long day hikes, which obviously won't appeal to everyone. So I decided to start from scratch and build a new list, based on the best of the easier hikes in the Grand Tetons. Hopefully you'll find this helpful as a starting point in trying to decide where to hike during your visit.

-  The Top 10 Hikes in Grand Teton National Park

http://www.tetonhikingtrails.com/string-lake-loop.htm
String Lake Loop - If you're looking for a hike that offers stunning scenery, but isn't physically demanding, the loop around String Lake is just about the perfect choice. I highly recommend starting this hike early in the morning to see the Grand Tetons reflecting in the water.

Taggart Lake - This is one of the more popular hikes in the park - and for good reason. By starting your hike early in the morning, hikers can still enjoy spectacular views of Grand Teton - on the trail and at the lake - in relative solitude.
