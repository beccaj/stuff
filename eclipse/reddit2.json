Although I'd highly recommend camping on top of Shadow Mountain. It's free, it's isolated, and the view when the sun sets behind the Teton Range and their shadows are cast aross all of Jackson Hole Valley.. well.. it's.. something truly special.  Not to mention you're close enough to all the major sights and trailheads in Grand Teton National Park. \n\nI'd recommend doing a portion of the Lupine Meadows trail (which will take you all the way to the summit of Middle Teton, should you feel so compelled) and maybe split off and check out Ampitheater Lake as well. \n\nAs for Yellowstone... where to begin?  I'll just tell you some of my favorite hikes/sights at the locations you listed.   I wouldn't recommend staying at Grant Village -- it's okay, but it's kind of far from all the other good stuff.  Stop there, check out the West Thumb Geyser Basin, then head on up to Lake/Fishing Bridge and try to camp at Fishing Bridge or Bridge Bay your first night. \n\nTwo of my favorite hikes in that area are \"Storm Point\" which is just a few miles east of Fishing Bridge, and \"Elephant Back\" -- both of which offer absolutely spectacular views of the Lake and surrounding areas.  While you're down in that area, I'd also recommend taking a drive down the East Entrance road, checking out some more of the lake views (you won't be able to get enough!) and maybe having lunch at Steamboat Point. Don't forge to check out Lake Hotel!\n\nLake to Canyon\n\nNext up is Canyon Village, but on your way there from Lake, take a quick stop at the Mud Volcano area and LeHardy rapids.  After that you'll drive through Hayden Valley, one of the best spots in the park to check out wildlife, so you'll catch a bunch of bison (hopefully not in the road!), elk, pronghorn, and maybe even some wolves if you're really lucky. Spend as much time as you feel like you need to there then keep going up the road toward Canyon. \n\nCanyon, Canyon, Canyon, you magnificent spectacle you. I lived here for months and still never got enough of it, so having only one day to explore it is tough. But, pressed on time, make sure you head to Uncle Tom's Trail and Artist Point on South Rim Drive, and then hit the brink of the Lower Falls and then go to the other side and walk down the Red Rocks Trail.  Just ask anyone who works in the park how to get to any of these places and they'll point you in the right direction. If you're staying at Canyon, ask for Julie the front desk manager-- she's amazing. The campground at Canyon is pretty decent too. \n\nCanyon to Roosevelt\n\nYou'll drive over Dunraven Pass (hopefully it's open when you're there). At the top is Mount Washburn which is THE BEST hike to take if you're in Yellowstone and pressed on time. It's an easy 2 mile or so hike to the top and you can see EVERYTHING from the top. Seriously. Just do it. Mount Washburn. There's an old fire watchtower on the top that you can stop and check out too. It's awesome. Do it. \n\nOnce you've conquered Mt. Washburn, head down towards Roosevelt. There's a campground at Tower which is where you'll stay if you're camping but I highly recommend driving a few more minutes down the road and staying in one of the rustic cabins at Roosevelt (if they have any vacancies, which they probably won't, but it's worth a shot). Tower Fall is pretty cool, I guess, but it's always super super busy with tourists getting ice cream at the general store there, and since you're pressed on time.. skip it.  Go to Lamar Valley instead. \n\nLamar Valley. Wow. Hands down, my favorite place in all of Yellowstone. Wolves and bison and bears and elk and pronghorn and hawks and well the valley itself. It's amazing. Get up early and go there and hang out with the wolf watchers. They'll let you use their scopes. If you go to Yellowstone and don't go to Lamar Valley, you did it wrong. Drive all the way through it and do a quick hike at Trout Lake. Good, good stuff. \n\nMammoth\n\nI don't know, it's just me, in my humblest of opinions, but if you're short on time, Mammoth would be the location to skip.  Sure, Mammoth Hot Springs are pretty wild things to behold. But most of it is dormant, it's super crowded being as that it's park headquarters and the entrance for most tourists, and well, I don't know. I just didn't enjoy it as much as other areas of the park. Well, except for the Boiling River.  Which is awesome. It's on the road towards Gardiner, and it's a natural hot spring fed part of the river that you can swim in. So if you feel like taking a dip in one of the park's few spots where you can (legally) swim in the thermal features, hit up The Boiling River. Also, the Lava Creek Trail is one of my favorites. \n\nNext up is Norris Geyser Basin, which you should most definitely make a stop at.  It's a nice little boardwalk hike around the geyser basin and is the closest thing to standing on an alien planet that this country has to offer.  It's crazy. Maybe if you're lucky Steamboat Geyser will go off when you're there. \n\nThen shoot all the way down to Old Faithful (Old Filthy, as we savages like to call it) Make sure you stop along the way at the Fountain Paint Pots and Midway Geyser Basin (Grand Prismatic!!!)  Then keep going. If you feel like taking a swim, take the Firehole Canyon drive and swim in the Firehole River at one of my favorite swimming holes in the park (besides the secret ones, which I won't tell you about!) \n\nOld Faithful is like Grand Central Station of Yellowstone. There's an actual overpass on the road down there, which blew my mind the first time seeing it. Anyways, go there, watch Old Faithful erupt, walk around the rest of the geyser basin, eat some ice cream. La la la. \n\nThat'll put you close to the West Entrance and on your way back to SLC\n\n\nI hope that helps! I've just so happened to be thinking a lot about the park today and will probably go back and work there again at some point this summer. Enjoy your trip! And if you have any further questions, just ask. I'm a wealth of information about the park and only skimmed the surface of things to do with this post. \n\n\n\n", "link_title": "Here's a tentative itinerary for my Grand Teton and Yellowstone trip in August with a few questions.
