Delays and Closures Due to Road Work
A major pavement preservation project continues in Rocky Mountain National Park.
This important project is critical for the long term protection of park roads
and parking areas. In addition to closures and delays listed below, expect up
to 20 minute rolling delays due to striping and other road work throughout the
 park. (I think this is done by the time we get there)



The following closures are part of the Canyon Overlooks and Trails
Restoration Project and other efforts:

Inspiration Point
Inspiration Point and Inspiration Point road are closed for reconstruction:
expect completion in spring 2018. This closure also includes the North
Rim Trail between Grand View Point and Inspiration Point.

North Rim Trail
The North Rim Trail is closed between Cascade Falls and the Brink of
Lower Falls, and between Grand View Point and Inspiration Point.
During this closure, people will not be able to walk the full
length of the North Rim Trail.

Uncle Tom's Point, Uncle Tom's Trail & South Rim Trail
Uncle Tom's Point and Parking Area, Uncle Tom's Trail (the stairs),
and the entire South Rim Trail are closed for reconstruction: expect
completion in spring of 2018.

Additional, short-term closures may occur throughout the year.
